No reassurance. Light-shift from emotion to responsibility. Example: 'Acceptance isn't the same as tolerance for harm. If your behavior consistently makes you the 'bad guy,' that's feedback about the behavior, not persecution. You can change the pattern or accept the social consequences—both are legitimate choices with different costs.'"}]}

Layered Truth: (1) Deception creates different harm than truth. (2) You're choosing which harm to cause, not whether to cause harm. (3) Decide: short-term comfort via lies, or long-term trust via truth. No false equivalence between 'harsh truth' and 'kind deception.'"}]}
